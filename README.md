1. Define a global shell variable to your cloned repo.

1. cd into a program's folder.

   ### Hello program

   The <strong>hello</strong> program contains an enhanced "hello world" example.

1. For testing, build the source into an executable and invoke it in one step:

   <pre>
   cd hello
   go run hello.go
   cd ..
   </pre>

1. Build the source files into a new executable file (with no file extension), then run the executable:

   <pre>
   cd hello
   go build 
   ./hello
   cd ..
   </pre>

1. Execute the executable created:

   <pre>
   chmod 555 hello
   ./hello
   cd ..
   </pre>
